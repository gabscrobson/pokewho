        <p>Welcome {{session["username"]}}! Pokewho is a web game developed to be used as my Web III class final project.</p>
        <p>The game is simple, a Pokémon silhouette is shown on the screen, and you must guess the name of the Pokémon to catch it. It's challenging and addictive, and you'll never know which Pokemon you'll get next.</p>
        <p>You can view your own box of Pokemon and other players' boxes, and also use your cash to buy rare Pokemon on the market, making your collection even more impressive.</p>
